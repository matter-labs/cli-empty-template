# zkSync Hardhat project

This project was scaffolded with [zksync-cli](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-cli).

## Project structure

- `/contracts`: smart contracts.
- `/deploy`: deployment and contract interaction scripts.
- `/test`: test files
- `hardhat.config.ts`: configuration file.

## Commands

- `yarn hardhat compile` will compile the contracts.
- `yarn run deploy` will execute the deployment scripts inside the `/deploy` folder.
- `yarn test`: run tests. **Check test requirements below.**


### Environment variables

In order to prevent users to leak private keys, this project includes the `dotenv` package which is used to load environment variables. It's recommended to use it to load the wallet private key in different scripts like deploy.

To use it, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your private key.

```
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=123cde574ccff....
```

### Local testing

In order to run test, you need to start the zkSync local environment. Please check [this section of the docs](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/api/hardhat/testing.html#prerequisites) which contains all the details.

If you do not start the zkSync local environment, the tests will fail with error `Error: could not detect network (event="noNetwork", code=NETWORK_ERROR, version=providers/5.7.2)`
